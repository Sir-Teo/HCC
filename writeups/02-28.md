## Our Dataset

| Dataset | Total Patients | Positive Cases (Recurrence) |
|---------|---------------|----------------------------|
| NYU  (testing) | 122            | 9                          |
| TCGA-LIHC (training) | 322         | 147                          |

## Stanford-HCC Dataset

In *Deep learning predicts postsurgical recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma from digital histopathologic images* by Shen et al. They train their CNN based model on the TCGA-LIHC dataset ($n = 352$ patients and with 176 recurrence ) and inference on their internal Stanford-HCC dataset n = 198, recurrence = 68), and got a c-index of 0.68

### C-Index

```
Bootstrap Concordance Index: Mean = 0.6970, 95% CI = [0.5093, 0.8509]
```

## TODO

Use Nested Cross-Validation
