## Dataset
The dataset consists of **122 patients** split into training, validation, and test sets 

| Dataset | Total Patients | Positive Cases (Recurrence) |
|---------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Train   | 85            | 6                          |
| Validation | 18         | 2                          |
| Test    | 19            | 1                          |

## Nested CV

Implemented nested-cv the concordance index is [0.1,0.9], the inference is not meaningful because our test set is too small.

## Incorporate other datasets

### Public dataset

The only publicly available dataset is TCGA-LIHC dataset, which contains $n = 352$ patients and with 176 recurrences. I am currently processing this dataset.

### Stanford-HCC Dataset

In *Deep learning predicts postsurgical recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma from digital histopathologic images* by Shen et al. They train their CNN based model on the TCGA-LIHC dataset and inference on their internal Stanford-HCC dataset n = 198, recurrence = 68), and got a c-index of 0.68

### Other datasets

In *MRI-based radiomics model for preoperative prediction of 5-year survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma* by Wang et al. They have a internal dataset (n = 201, recurrence = 138) and may be available if we ask them
