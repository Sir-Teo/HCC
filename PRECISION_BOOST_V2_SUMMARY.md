# HCC Binary Classification - Precision Boost V2 Summary

## Analysis Results from Previous Runs

### Best Performing Configuration (Trial 5 - Job 875892)
- **Final Precision**: 0.1333 (significant improvement over baseline 0.0641)
- **Configuration**: 
  - Architecture: Simple MLP (not complex precision-focused ones)
  - Upsampling: Random (outperformed SMOTE/ADASYN)
  - Learning Rate: Very low (2.16e-06)
  - Batch Size: 16
  - Slices: 40
  - Loss: Standard cross-entropy (focal loss didn't help)
  - Threshold: AUPRC-based tuning

### What Worked ✅
1. **Simple MLP Architecture** - Outperformed complex precision-focused designs
2. **Random Upsampling** - More effective than SMOTE/ADASYN for extreme imbalance
3. **Very Low Learning Rates** - Critical for stability with extreme imbalance
4. **AUPRC Threshold Tuning** - Better than F1-based approaches
5. **Standard Cross-Entropy Loss** - Focal loss variants added complexity without benefit

### What Didn't Work ❌
1. **Complex Architectures** - Ultra-precision, precision-weighted ensemble performed worse
2. **SMOTE/ADASYN** - Standard methods struggled with 1 positive per fold
3. **Focal Loss Variants** - Added complexity without precision improvement
4. **Validation Issues** - Many folds had 0 positive validation samples
5. **Higher Learning Rates** - Caused instability and poor convergence

## Implemented Improvements in V2

### 1. Enhanced Random Upsampling (`enhanced_random_upsampling`)
- **Multi-technique Augmentation**:
  - Noise injection with varying intensities (0.001-0.05)
  - Feature-wise perturbation (5-15% of features)
  - Interpolation between positive samples using beta distribution
- **Targets**: Up to 70 positive samples (capped for stability)
- **Benefits**: Works reliably with single positive samples per fold

### 2. Robust Threshold Tuning (`robust_threshold_tuning`)
- **Handles 0 Positive Validation**: Falls back to training set when needed
- **Synthetic Threshold Setting**: Uses 75th percentile for edge cases
- **Multiple Metrics**: Precision, F1, AUPRC-balanced (F1.5 favoring precision)
- **Granular Search**: 81 threshold points (0.1-0.9)
- **Benefits**: Reliable threshold tuning even with extreme imbalance

### 3. Optimized Simple Architectures
#### `OptimizedSimpleMLP`
- **Based on Best Trial**: 512→256→128→64→1 architecture

- **Xavier Initialization**: Proven effective initialization
- **Benefits**: Simplicity with optimized configuration

#### `OptimizedMLPEnsemble`
- **Multiple Simple MLPs**: 3 models with different dropout rates

- **Benefits**: Combines multiple simple models for robustness

### 4. Updated Hyperparameter Search Bias
- **Architecture Weights**: 
  - Optimized Simple: 30%
  - Optimized Ensemble: 20% 
  - Basic MLP: 25%
  - Complex architectures: <10% each
- **Upsampling Bias**: Random upsampling increased to 50% weight

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Precision Targets
- **Current Best**: 0.1333 (Trial 5)
- **Target Range**: 0.15-0.20 with new optimizations
- **Key Drivers**: Enhanced upsampling + robust threshold tuning

### Stability Improvements
- **Validation Robustness**: No more failures on 0 positive validation sets
- **Upsampling Reliability**: Works with single positive samples per fold
- **Threshold Consistency**: Reliable optimization across all scenarios

### Cross-Validation Reliability
- **7-Fold Consistency**: Each fold gets exactly 1 positive sample
- **Balanced Upsampling**: ~70 positive samples per fold after augmentation
